          We provide advise on best practice for making home automation for your home upon on-site visits or off-site discussions. The design process often begins with a meeting which helps us to inform you of the current smart devices and the choices you have for the systems. In this process, you would get better understanding of the technology and how it might satisfy your needs. <br><br> Then, we map out your home automation requirement such as the smart devices, the necessary electrical and network designs that are needed for the system. We will work within parameters and your budget to provide you with a truly cost-effective solution for your smart home system. If required, we will be working closely with your architects and builders to determine the best design and system for acheiving your goals.

The products will be tried and tested prior to the installation. Moreover, most of our products are compatible with the smart home systems offered by big technology companies such as Amazon, Apple and Google. This way you have the options of using the control systems that are maintained by these companies.

      - question: Is the smart home techology safe?
        answer: >-
          Yes, at least reasonably so. We have certified electricians to perform the hardware installations and our procedures are compliant to the territory regulations.
      - question: Is the smart home techology secure?
        answer: >-
          Yes, at least reasonably so. There is always a trade-off between security and convenience. Convenience often requires more devices to be connected and be able to communicate with each other. With this, the suspectibility to hacking would inevitably arise. However, if your smart home system is only locally connected (i.e., not connecting to the internet), then your smart home system would be considered fairly secure. Hackers would need to be on-site before they can make any attempt. However, your access to your home devices would also be limited to be on-site only. <br><br>What if your system is connected to the internet? We follow the digital communication protocols set forth by the big technology companies to ensure that such connections are securely encrypted. Those protocols are vigorously monitored to protect your digital communications.
