Founded in Canberra in Spring 2020, we are a company that provides specialised services installing smart automation system for residential homes and commercial units. Our works are performed to the highest standards of efficiency and great attention to details within affordable budgets.

Our mission is to promote the adoption of smart home automations, starting locally from this beautiful city in which we are living. We see many benefits in having a smart home system. It could reduce our energy consumption by only turning on devices when we need them. To quote tech journalist Chandler, "even if we cannot wean ourselves off our insatiable appetite for more and more energy, the Internet of Things will at least help us avoid the worst effects of our gluttony". Not to mention smart home automations also make our home more secure and free up our time to do the things that matters. We feel that many have yet to discover the benefits of having a smart home system and we have taken upon ourselves to advance the adoption of smart home technologies.

There are myriads of smart devices out there and more being developed each day, from which we have curated a list of high caliber products, i.e. our SmartMinions. We believe there are suitable systems for every home from cottages to castles and everything in between. Contact us and we will discuss what kind of smart home automation systems that are available for you.
