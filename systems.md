          A basic setup of home automation typically includes connecting lighting devices, either via the light bulbs or switches connected to the bulbs. Depending on the devices, you may adjust the brightness level and colour temperature in addition to the simple ON and OFF settings. Here's some of the combinations you can do:

          * Lighting colour turning from cool in the day to warm in the evening.

          * Outdoor flood light that turns on when motion is detected at night.

          * Soft lighting in the bathroom that turns on when motion is detected at night.


          It brings much possibilities to help you get creative and help you personalise your lighting to suit your lifestyle.

          How good does it feel to wake up to natural light? With SmartMinions, you could set the curtains to open at pre-set time with programmable and motorised curtains and blinds. Combined with light sensors, we can have the system to maintain a desired brightness level of your room by letting the appropriate amount of natural daylight and automatically turn on in-door lighting in a cloud-covered day.

          Come home with your garage door automatically opened, and never have to worry about forgetting to shut your garage door.

          * Automatically open by recognising your car (not just any car)

          * Automatically closes when you shut your car engine from inside the garage

          * <strong>Safety feature</strong> - preventing the door from shutting on children and small animals


          As with many of our devices, the system can be implemented wirelessly, with and without remote controls.

          With cleverly positioned sensors and security cameras around your house, we can develop a security system for your home. With our technology, you can check the status of your home while at work or on holiday and be notified when the system detects potential threats. The sensitivity and trigger for notifications can be tailored to your specific needs. Smart locks allow you to unlock your home from anywhere in the world, and send digital keys with either unlimited access, between specified times or for a one time use only.

    title: An integrated system
    content: >-
      The true strength of the smart home automation is best displayed in an integrated system where individual smart devices and appliances interact with one and other to form an intelligent home automation. The system can be configurated to make your home more energy efficient, more comfortable and more secure.<br><br>The components mentioned above can be integrated into a system where you can program a series of actions and then trigger them at one-click (or automatically). This is sometimes called scene control. For example, an 'away from home' scene could activate motion sensors around the house and send you notifications concerning potential threats, and automatically turn lighting on and off throughout the house to create an illustration of your presence, thereby reducing the chance of threats. A 'guest-hosting' scene could mean brighter rooms and musics playing in the background. There are countless way you can make your home works for you, leaving you more time to spend on things that matter! We can also help you to get started by configurating some of your essential scenes!<br><br>Depending on your integrated system, we could link your smart home automation with Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, and Google Assistant, unlocking the convenience of voice control.
