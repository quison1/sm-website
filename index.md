          Set your curtains and blinds to open automatically with programmable setting and motorised parts. Combined with light sensors, your home can maintain a desired brightness level by dynamically letting daylight in and automatically turn on in-door lighting in a cloud-covered day.

          Come home with your garage door automatically opened, and never have to worry about forgetting to shut your garage door. All of these can be done wirelessly, with and without remote controls.

          SmartMinions provide a reliable smart garage door system. I don't have to worry about shutting the garage door and misplacing my garage remotes - it recognises my cars, then opens and closes automatically!

          I got a smart home security system from SmartMinions at a fraction of costs by other providers - cannot recommend them enough!
